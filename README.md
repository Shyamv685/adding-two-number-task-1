Ascending Order Sorting in Java

This Java program allows the user to enter a set of numbers and then sorts them in ascending order using a simple sorting algorithm.

How It Works

The program prompts the user to input the number of elements in the array.

The user then inputs the elements.

The program sorts the elements in ascending order using a nested loop (Bubble Sort logic).

Finally, the sorted elements are displayed.

Usage

Compile the program:

javac Ascending_Order.java

Run the program:

java Ascending_Order

Enter the number of elements and then input the elements when prompted.

Example

Input:

Enter no. of elements you want in array: 5
Enter all the elements:
34
12
5
67
23

Output:

Ascending Order: 5,12,23,34,67

Notes

The sorting algorithm used here is a basic Bubble Sort approach.

The program reads input using Scanner and sorts the array using a nested loop.

For larger datasets, consider using Arrays.sort() for better performance.
